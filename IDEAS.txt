Based on Endgame theme

Start in middle of game, with potentially limited health, some items, or other world state already in a state
that feels explicitly done by the player before they actually start.

--------

from theme.txt:

As you gain some kind of strength/power, it adds to strain, lowering HP.
Absorb and release power at will.
How about vision / perception getting worse? Render artifacts, etc.
Affecting controls

Absorb souls for power, release them by performing certain actions (requiring a # of souls)
Looking at enemies costs HP, but most do so to absorb souls.
As you gain more souls, max HP decreases, but HP is auto-regen.

Keywords: balancing act

--------

1 scene

Player explores an area, building up something in their body/mind, some uncontrollable power.
As this energy grows, the player starts getting problems in terms of vision and control,
like a sanity meter. During the game, it only builds up and leads to some finale where 
everything is at an extreme, maybe with a chase / escape scene.

Q: what is causing the energy build-up?
- could be based on time
- fixed locations increasing the energy to exactly control what effects happen when
- absorb some kind of material in various places, same as above but more explicit
- some other interaction

Q: who is the player?
- no special powers, just a human being, also no fighting skills, etc.

Q: what is the player doing and why?
- commanded to fetch some stuff from a place, like treasure or a McGuffin from a temple/cave/house
- self initiated, wants to gain power or find something
	- is the player aware from the start that this energy is here?

Q: what is the end condition / goal?
- get what you came for and get out
- player will refuse to leave before all places are explored / all energy is built up
- either:
	- explore all spaces, treasure is in last place
	- level guides progress, effecting specific travel path back to exit
- 1 artifact in 3 or 4 pieces, scattered about the place in coffins
- maybe some puzzles to open these coffins?

Q: what is the location?
- tomb in graveyard, let's keep things classical
- dungeon like, hallways and rooms
- enough room to potentially evade chaser
- dark to hide boringness
- maybe a cel/toon shaded like style for simplicity?

Q: what is the challenge?
- primarily the control and vision of the player deteriorating
- an Amnesia monster coming to check stuff out at critical times, will disappear 
	- danger of dumb-ass monster syndrome
	- monsters should give chase if player spotted + delay
	- monsters should be invisible / shadow like things, sound based (as obscure as possible to hide dumbness)
	- get caught = dead, no hits or scratches or whatnot
- final monster will be a chase back to exit after finding last part
	- like the Amnesia shadow after water level and prison. Lag = dead, but now with shakycam

Total Runtime: 2-4 mins + puzzle solving time

### MUST HAVES
- tomb level layout with 2 to 4 coffin rooms
- inventory state machine and colliders acting on it
	- also player interactable colliders / triggers
- sluggish controls / visuals based on progress
- simple artifact and part models
- some textures
- a shade / shadow / baddie
- appropriate music and sounds
	- base music
	- danger music
	- gargl
	- glabargl
- title screen with:
	- keyboard options
	- viewport size / fullscreen
- ending screen

### WOULD LIKE TO HAVES
- final chase scene (corridor)
- shades showing up and disappearing
- puzzles to open each tomb
- doors that only open if you have > n parts of the artifact
- a nice base shader for interesting visual style
- some nods to Frictional classics

### NICE TO HAVES
- other atmospheric stuff, lighting effects, etc.
- watery rooms for extra chills
- proper collision mesh
