Based on Endgame theme

Start in middle of game, with potentially limited health, some items, or other world state already in a state
that feels explicitly done by the player before they actually start.

--------

from theme.txt:

As you gain some kind of strength/power, it adds to strain, lowering HP.
Absorb and release power at will.
How about vision / perception getting worse? Render artifacts, etc.
Affecting controls

Absorb souls for power, release them by performing certain actions (requiring a # of souls)
Looking at enemies costs HP, but most do so to absorb souls.
As you gain more souls, max HP decreases, but HP is auto-regen.

Keywords: balancing act

--------

1 scene

Player explores an area, building up something in their body/mind, some uncontrollable power.
As this energy grows, the player starts getting problems in terms of vision and control,
like a sanity meter. During the game, it only builds up and leads to some finale where 
everything is at an extreme, maybe with a chase / escape scene.

Q: what is causing the energy build-up?
- could be based on time
- fixed locations increasing the energy to exactly control what effects happen when
- absorb some kind of material in various places, same as above but more explicit
- some other interaction

Q: who is the player?
- no special powers, just a human being, also no fighting skills, etc.

Q: what is the player doing and why?
- commanded to fetch some stuff from a place, like treasure or a McGuffin from a temple/cave/house
- self initiated, wants to gain power or find something
	- is the player aware from the start that this energy is here?

Q: what is the end condition / goal?
- get what you came for and get out
- player will refuse to leave before all places are explored / all energy is built up
- either:
	- explore all spaces, treasure is in last place
	- level guides progress, effecting specific travel path back to exit

Q: what is the location?
- 

Q: what is the challenge?
- primarily the control and vision of the player deteriorating
- an Amnesia monster coming to check stuff out at critical times, will disappear 
	- danger of dumb-ass monster syndrome
	- monsters should give chase if player spotted + delay
	- monsters should be invisible / shadow like things, sound based (as obscure as possible to hide dumbness)
	- get caught = dead, no hits or scratches or whatnot
- final monster will be a chase back to exit after finding last part
	- like the Amnesia shadow after water level and prison. Lag = dead, but now with shakycam
